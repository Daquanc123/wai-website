## Technical, implementation, and other support questions

### WAI website

Many questions about web accessibility are addressed on the WAI website.
* Good starting places to find relevant resources are [Accessibility Fundamentals Overview listing page](/fundamentals/), [Introduction to Web Accessibility](/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) and [WAI resources](/resources/).
* For information on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), see the [WCAG 2 Overview](/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

### Mailing list for accessibility questions

WAI hosts a WAI Interest Group (IG) mailing list for discussion of digital accessibility issues and questions. The list is open for anyone to read, submit, and respond to it. If you have a question that might be relevant to the WAI IG list, you can:

-   search the [WAI IG mailing list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/) to see if the topic of your question has already been addressed
-   read the [Mailing Lists](/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist) section of the WAI IG page for guidance on contributing to a comfortable, constructive exchange of ideas
-  [subscribe to the Discussion List](/about/groups/waiig/#subscribing-and-unsubscribing-to-the-discussion-list) and post your questions.

## Feedback on specific documents

To submit comments on a specific document:

-   Most WAI web pages have a 'Help improve this page' box near the bottom of the page, where you can find links to propose edits and submit issues through GitHub or by email.
-   For [W3C guidelines](/standards-guidelines/), [Draft Notes](/standards/types/#x2-5-1-draft-note), and [Working Drafts](/standards/types/#x4-1-working-draft) that are under <code>www.w3.org/TR</code>, see the 'Status of This Document' section for the email address and/or GitHub repository to send comments.

If you cannot determine where to send comments on a specific document, email <a href="mailto:wai@w3.org?body=%5Binclude%20a%20relevant%20email%20Subject%5D%0A%0A%5Bput%20comment%20here...%5D%0A%0AI%20give%20permission%20to%20share%20this%20to%20a%20publicly-archived%20email%20list.">wai@w3.org</a> with the document name in the subject line and the permission to send your email to a publicly-archived email list. We will forward your message to the appropriate place.
